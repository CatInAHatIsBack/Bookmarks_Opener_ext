# Bookmarks_Opener_ext

Dont wanna pay 5$ google account fee so if you are interested build from git yourself.

This is a no dependency chrome ext for opening list of links and/or saving to  bookmarks.

To save to bookmarks you need to create bookmarks on the "Bookmarks Bar" called and call it extension_hook.
folder names will be saved as date and time of creation. 

If preserve is checked it will store values in chrome.storage.local

Restore will get options from storage
